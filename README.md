# AAVE paraswap collector

Paraswap rewards part of positive slippage to the referrer which in case of swaps performed trough the decentralized ipfs aave interface is the aave protocol itself.
Currently these rewards can be claimed trough aave governance & respective guardians which is suboptimal as claiming has to go trough governance or be coordinated with a multisig.

The contract presented here aims to simplify this process by allow anyone to claim to the aave treasury.
